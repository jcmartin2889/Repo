<HR><A NAME="what"><H3>What is Equation Common?</H3></A>
The Equation Common Java Library is a set of Java classes that allow you to 
access Equation data and programs through a Java program. With these classes,
you can write your own java applications that work with Equation functionality
and can be deployed on any platform with a supported Java Virtual Machine.

The Library is available as a stand-alone component or is additionally released 
as an underpinning component of several Misys products that are based in Java
technology. This includes, but is not limited to the BankFusion Equation 
release.

Newer versions of the Library should be backwards-compatible with earlier
versions. Upgrading to a newer version is usually recommended.

<A NAME="req"><H4><U>Requirements</U></H4></A>
When using the Equation Common library within your own applications (i.e. when
it is not a component of a separately delivered product or component) the 
requirements for using the Library are as follows:

<H5>Equation Server</H5>
1. An AS/400 (IBM i) with OS V5R4 or higher.

2. The server must have the Option 12 Host Servers installed and running. 
   (this is a requirement of <A HREF="http://jt400.sourceforge.net/">JTOpen</A> which is used for communications with the 
   server).

<H5>Equation</H5>
1. Equation 4.0 with the latest FX release recommended.
   
<H5>Java Client</H5>
1. A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with a 1.5.x or higher JDK/JRE. 

2. jt400.jar available from <A HREF="http://jt400.sourceforge.net/">JTOpen</A> version 6.1 or higher. This is required for
   connectivity the Equation APIs via IBM's open source implementation of JDBC
   as well as other utility classes provided in the library. 

3. commons-logging-1.1.1.jar or higher (within release 1.1.x) available from 
   <A HREF="http://commons.apache.org/logging/">logging</A>. Required as a standard bridge to the log4j implementation (below).

4. log4j-1.2.15.jar or higher (within release 1.2.x) available from <A HREF="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">log4j</A>. 
   Required as the standard implementation logging.
   
5. spring.jar. available from <A HREF="http://www.springsource.org/">spring</A>. Required for database connectivity.
